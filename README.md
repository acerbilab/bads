# Bayesian Adaptive Direct Search (BADS) - v1.1.0

**News:** 
- 31/Oct/22: BADS 1.1.0 released! Added full support for user-specified noise (e.g., for heteroskedastic targets) and several fixes.
- If you are interested in Bayesian model fitting, check out [Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo (VBMC)](https://github.com/acerbilab/vbmc), a simple and user-friendly toolbox for Bayesian posterior and model inference that we published at NeurIPS (2018, 2020).

## What is it?

BADS is a fast hybrid Bayesian optimization algorithm designed to solve difficult optimization problems, in particular related to fitting computational models (e.g., via [maximum likelihood estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation)).

BADS has been intensively tested for fitting behavioral, cognitive, and neural models, and is currently being used in many computational labs around the world.
In our benchmark with real model-fitting problems, BADS performed on par or better than many other common and state-of-the-art MATLAB optimizers, such as `fminsearch`, `fmincon`, and `cmaes` [[1](#reference)].

BADS is recommended when no gradient information is available, and the objective function is non-analytical or *noisy*, for example evaluated through numerical approximation or via simulation.

BADS requires no specific tuning and runs off-the-shelf like other built-in MATLAB optimizers such as `fminsearch`.

If you are interested in estimating posterior distributions (i.e., uncertainty and error bars) over parameters, and not just point estimates, you might want to check out [Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo](https://github.com/acerbilab/vbmc), a toolbox for Bayesian posterior and model inference which can be used in synergy with BADS.

## Installation

[**Download the latest version of BADS as a ZIP file**](https://github.com/acerbilab/bads/archive/master.zip).
- To install BADS, clone or unpack the zipped repository where you want it and run the script `install.m`.
   - This will add the BADS base folder to the MATLAB search path.
- To see if everything works, run `bads('test')`.

## Quick start

The BADS interface is similar to that of other MATLAB optimizers. The basic usage is:

```matlab
[X,FVAL] = bads(FUN,X0,LB,UB,PLB,PUB);
```
with input parameters:
- `FUN`, a function handle to the objective function to minimize (typically, the *negative* log likelihood of a dataset and model, for a given input parameter vector);
- `X0`, the starting point of the optimization (a row vector);
- `LB` and `UB`, hard lower and upper bounds;
- `PLB` and `PUB`, *plausible* lower and upper bounds, that is a box where you would expect to find almost all solutions.

The output parameters are:
- `X`, the found optimum.
- `FVAL`, the (estimated) function value at the optimum.

For more usage examples, see [**bads_examples.m**](https://github.com/acerbilab/bads/blob/master/bads_examples.m). You can also type `help bads` to display the documentation.

For practical recommendations, such as how to set `LB` and `UB`, and any other question, check out the FAQ on the [BADS wiki](https://github.com/acerbilab/bads/wiki).

*Note*: BADS is a *semi-local* optimization algorithm, in that it can escape local minima better than many other methods â€” but it can still get stuck. The best performance for BADS is obtained by running the algorithm multiple times from distinct starting points (see [here](https://github.com/acerbilab/bads/wiki#how-do-i-choose-the-starting-point-x0)).

## How does it work?

BADS follows a [mesh adaptive direct search](http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/040603371) (MADS) procedure for function minimization that alternates **poll** steps and **search** steps (see **Fig 1**). 

- In the **poll** stage, points are evaluated on a mesh by taking steps in one direction at a time, until an improvement is found or all directions have been tried. The step size is doubled in case of success, halved otherwise. 
- In the **search** stage, a [Gaussian process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_process) (GP) is fit to a (local) subset of the points evaluated so far. Then, we iteratively choose points to evaluate according to a *lower confidence bound* strategy that trades off between exploration of uncertain regions (high GP uncertainty) and exploitation of promising solutions (low GP mean).
